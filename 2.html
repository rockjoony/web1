  <p>You want commitment, and take a look into these eyes.<br>
  They burn with fire, Yeah, until the end of time.<br>
  And I would do anything, I'd beg, I'd steal,<br>
  I'd die to have you in theses arms tonight.<br>
  Baby I want you like the roses want the rain,<br>
  You know I need you like a poet needs the pain.<br>
  And I would give anything. My blood, my love, my life.<br>
  If you were in these arms tonight.</p>

  <p>I'd hold you, I'd need you,<br>
  I'd get down on my knees for you.<br>
  And make everything alright,<br>
  If you were in these arms.<br>
  I'd love you, I'd please you,<br>
  I'd tell you that I'd never leave you.<br>
  And love you till the end of time,<br>
  if you were in these arms tonight.<br>
  Oh, yeah.</p>

  <p>We stare at the sun, and we made a promise.<br>
  A promise this world would never blind us.<br>
  And these were our words.<br>
  Our words were our songs.<br>
  Our songs are our prayers.<br>
  These prayers keep me strong, and I still believe.<br>
  If you were in these arms.</p>

  <p>I'd hold you, I'd need you,<br>
  I'd get down on my knees for you.<br>
  And make everything alright,<br>
  If you were in these arms.<br>
  I'd love you, I'd please you,<br>
  I'd tell you that I'd never leave you.<br>
  And love you till the end of time,<br>
  if you were in these arms tonight.</P>

  <p>Your clothes are still scattered all over our room.<br>
  This whole place still smells like your cheap perfume.<br>
  Everything here reminds me of you.<br>
  There's nothing I wouldn't do.</p>

  <p>And these were our words, they keep me strong, baby.<br>
  I'd hold you, I'd need you,<br>
  I'd get down on my knees for you.<br>
  And make everything alright,<br>
  If you were in these arms.<br>
  I'd love you, I'd please you,<br>
  I'd tell you that I'd never leave you.<br>
  And love you till the end of time,<br>
  if you were in these arms tonight.<br>
  If you were in these arms<br>
  Baby, like the roses need the rain.<br>
  Like the seasons need to change.<br>
  Like the seasons need to change.</p>
